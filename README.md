Crypto savings for kids. 

When families send their savings for their children via crypto, it ensures that children cannot withdraw their savings until a certain age.

The contract creator sends Ether to the children's addresses. 

Every child has a certain characteristic. 


-wallet address 


-first name


-second name


-when he can withdraw the savings 


-Amount


-whether it is eligible to withdraw savings

When the amount is added, it appears in children's wallets.


The amount saved by the family for all children is kept.
